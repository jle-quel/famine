Famine roadmap

- language
- infection (type and residence)
- signature (residence)
- target
- anti debugging
- criteria of infection
- dependance (section header)
- obfuscation

- Test main with state machine and different program flow (does opcode look the same ?)
- When injecting a constructor does the entry point change ?
